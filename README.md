Book of Good
============

There's nothing more important for any of us individually or for the world as a whole, than for each of us to be **good**.  Goodness is what brings happiness now and in the future.  But what is goodness, and how do we achieve it?

People of the faiths of the world have many resources available to help them become better.  It seems as if there's less available to those of us who haven't accepted a religious faith.  There is no secular Bible.  And yet, advice such as this is as helpful to the nonbeliever as it is to the devout:

`... whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things.`

If we wish to see good outcomes in the world for ourselves and for others, then we must be urgently engaged in making ourselves better people.  There's no time to waste.  We need to infuse ourselves with very good ideas -- the very best that the world has to offer.  We need a book where these ideas have been collected so we can refer to them regularly.

But who would be qualified to write such a book?  Who would be bold enough?  Who would have enough time?  Who's flaws could be overlooked?  Sadly, there is no one.

There is no *one*, but there *is* all of us.

The **Book of Good** belongs to all of us.  Anyone can refer to it for their own betterment.  And anyone can contribute the greatest insights of their lifetime.  You can create your own version by changing a single word or all the words.  Add a comma or a chapter.  Delete, modify, rearrange.  Let a thousand flowers bloom.  Share your version with others to help them become the best they can be.  And hope that they then make it even better.
